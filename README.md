# XSLT-examples-for-MEI

This repository contains examples of XSLT to convert MEI files into:
- MEI (see [1_MEI-to-MEI](./XSLT-examples-for-MEI/1_MEI-to-MEI) folder)
- HTML (see [2_MEI-to-HTML](./XSLT-examples-for-MEI/2_MEI-to-HTML) folder)
- Text (see [3_meiCensus](./XSLT-examples-for-MEI/3_meiCensus) folder)
- TSV (see [4_meiPitchDistribution](./XSLT-examples-for-MEI/4_meiPitchDistribution) folder)

The first two folders contain examples on how to build the XSLT step by step.

All examples were provided by Perry Roland. These were divided into steps and accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation to upload in this repository.
