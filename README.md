# XSLT-examples-for-MEI

This repository contains examples of XSLT to convert MEI files into:
- Another MEI file ([`1_MEI-to-MEI`](./1_MEI-to-MEI) folder)
- An HTML file ([`2_MEI-to-HTML`](./2_MEI-to-HTML) folder)
- A text file ([`3_meiCensus`](./3_meiCensus) folder)
- A TSV file ([`4_meiPitchDistribution`](./4_meiPitchDistribution) folder)

The first two folders contain examples on how to build the XSLT step by step.

**All encoded material was provided by Perry Roland**, and divided into steps by Martha Thomae (together with the accompaning slides).
