# XSLT-examples-for-MEI

This repository contains examples of XSLT to convert MEI files into:
- Another MEI file ([`1_MEI-to-MEI`](./XSLT-examples-for-MEI/1_MEI-to-MEI) folder)
- An HTML file ([`2_MEI-to-HTML`](./XSLT-examples-for-MEI/2_MEI-to-HTML) folder)
- A text file ([`3_meiCensus`](./XSLT-examples-for-MEI/3_meiCensus) folder)
- A TSV file ([`4_meiPitchDistribution`](./XSLT-examples-for-MEI/4_meiPitchDistribution) folder)

The first two folders contain examples on how to build the XSLT step by step.

All examples were provided by Perry Roland. These were divided into steps and accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation to upload in this repository.
